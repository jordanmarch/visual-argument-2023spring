# Visual argument

**Preview as of 2/15**

I am working on getting down the basic elements of my argument. There are 2 layers currently, the one layer contains most of my images which makes up the person with the static television head. This is meant to represent the unconscious consumption of media and the potentially damaging effects this can have on an individual. I created this by just cutting out the parts of stock photos I wanted to use and rearranging them to create the figure. I also changed the image of the man to black and white to further propel my argument and to contrast with the colorful background of screens and advertisements. I intend on adding a billboard to the right side of the background that has my argument written out. This was challenging for me but I will need to figure out how to make the lighting and dimensions more realistic. As far as text, I am thinking of saying "We consume but do not digest". I am hoping these words leave a clear or understandable message with the audience, or at the very least I want it to make them think about their own actions and how they interact with media.  As far as the next steps go, I want to finish adding the billboard with my written argument, and I may add something like people holding their phones/ phone cameras up to border the bottom of the piece. I think this would be an interesting layer to add to my argument because people are always on their phones even if it is just taking pictures of what they're doing, but that takes away from the real experience and "digesting reality". I'm not sure how that will look though, so I am considering other options or leaving it out because I don't want things to get too overwhelming.
