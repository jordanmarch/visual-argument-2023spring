**Proposal**

For my visual argument, I am planning on raising questions about our constant, and often unconscious, media consumption. With social media, advertising, and technology everywhere we are always intaking new messages, but often not processing what we're really seeing. I plan to use words along the lines of "we consume but do not digest" to represent my argument and remind my audience to be conscious consumers. I think I want to use images of advertisements/ a lot of screens, something that maybe replicates times square?

I plan to use mostly adobe stock for images, adobe illustrator to create assets I can't find online, but I have to start hunting these assets down and see what I can find to get a better idea.

**Preview as of 2/15**

I am working on getting down the basic elements of my argument. There are 2 layers currently, the one layer contains most of my images which makes up the person with the static television head. This is meant to represent the unconscious consumption of media and the potentially damaging effects this can have on an individual. I created this by just cutting out the parts of stock photos I wanted to use and rearranging them to create the figure. I also changed the image of the man to black and white to further propel my argument and to contrast with the colorful background of screens and advertisements. I intend on adding a billboard to the right side of the background that has my argument written out. This was challenging for me but I will need to figure out how to make the lighting and dimensions more realistic. As far as text, I am thinking of saying "We consume but do not digest". I am hoping these words leave a clear or understandable message with the audience, or at the very least I want it to make them think about their own actions and how they interact with media.  As far as the next steps go, I want to finish adding the billboard with my written argument, and I may add something like people holding their phones/ phone cameras up to border the bottom of the piece. I think this would be an interesting layer to add to my argument because people are always on their phones even if it is just taking pictures of what they're doing, but that takes away from the real experience and "digesting reality". I'm not sure how that will look though, so I am considering other options or leaving it out because I don't want things to get too overwhelming. 

**Reflection**

For my rhetorical visual argument piece, titled Constant Consumption, I wanted my audience to consider the persistent presence of media around us and how we often consume media subconsciously without processing it as we take it in. Through the grey figure on their phone with a fuzzy TV head, I am arguing that with unconscious media consumption and a lack of truly processing and critically examining what we are taking in, we are harming ourselves. I chose the Times Square background because I think it is a strong, physical example of media and advertising bombardment, and it is a very popular area so many people will already know the where and what when they see the background image. I also thought this particular photo of Times Square was interesting and added a layer of meaning with the “Don’t believe the liberal media!” billboard. I think this can help translate my intended message to multiple audiences with different opinions and allows them to construct their own interpretation of the piece. My argument is written on the billboard to the right and says, “We consume but do not digest”. There are many possible interpretations of this message; it could concern media, capitalism, the two in conjunction, etc. I think the proximity of my added sign with the liberal media sign can stir thoughts on fake news for those on the right, left, or in between.  

When constructing this piece, I had decided to make the Times Square background image less saturated because I thought all the colors were a lot to absorb and distracted from the “We consume but do not digest” message.

However, a classmate pointed this out in a peer review and commented on how it took away from the black and white person.

While creating this project I became concerned with the overall visual appeal of the piece and lost track of the message I was really trying to argue. Once I read this peer review, I instantly changed the saturation of the background backup. This element of the design is such an essential part of my argument and the lack of background saturation distracted from the desaturated person and took away from the oversaturation of media point.  

I do think I met the baseline criteria. The contrast between saturation and black and white draws viewers’ eyes to the person, as well as the angled/perspective billboard that points toward the person. The billboard uses a bold and eye-catching font and red text to communicate my argument to viewers and matches the urgency of my message. For aspirational criteria, I used a lot of layers that are neatly organized into folders and sublayers. I think I changed the meaning of images as well by replacing a person’s head with a static television, changing its meaning and furthering my argument. I also used a variety of tools like shadows, glow, distortion, patch, blur, and saturation adjustments. I think the use of different tools is particularly noticeable in the billboard I created to display my argument. I wanted it to look authentic so I added a pixely overlay and glow/shadow effects to make it look like a real screen.
